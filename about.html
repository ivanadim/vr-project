            <h2>What is Virtual Reality ?</h2>
            <p>Virtual reality is the use of computer technology to create simulated environments. Virtual reality
                places
                the user inside a three-dimensional experience. Instead of viewing a screen in front of them, users are
                immersed in and interact with 3D worlds.
                Simulation of human senses—all five of them—transforms a computer into a vehicle into new worlds. The
                only
                limitation to a superb VR experience is computing power and content availability.

        <h2>The Three Types of Virtual Reality</h2>

        <div class="types">
            <div class="type">
                <h3>Non-Immersive Virtual Reality: </h3>
                <div>
                    <p>This catgory is often overlooked as VR simply because it’s so common. Non-immersive VR
                        technology features a computer-generated virtual environment where the user simultaneously
                        remains
                        aware and controlled by their physical environment. Video games are a prime example of
                        non-immersive VR.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="type">
                <h3>Semi-Immersive Virtual Reality: </h3>
                <div>
                    <p>This type of VR provides an experience partially based in a virtual environment. This type of
                        VR makes sense for educational and training purposes with graphical computing and large
                        projector systems, such as flight simulators for pilot trainees.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="type">
                <h3>Fully Immersive Virtual Reality:</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>Right now, there are no completely immersive VR technologies, but advances are so swift that
                        they may be right around the corner. This type of VR generates the most realistic simulation
                        experience, from sight to sound to sometimes even olfactory sensations. Car racing games are
                        an example of immersive virtual reality that gives the user the sensation of speed and driving
                        skills. Developed for gaming and other entertainment purposes, VR use in other sectors is
                        increasing.</p>

            <p>If you think you can make great strides in your business with VR, you think correctly.
                Whether in education, construction, or healthcare, virtual reality is a great practice canvas for
                professionals to perform activities in a virtual environment that can be risk-inducing otherwise.

            <h2>The best VR apps for 2022</h2>
            <p>If you think virtual reality apps are designed just for gaming, think again. VR headsets are more
                accessible than ever before thanks to products like the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, or Sony PlayStation VR.
                Developers

                    <p>Travel is one of the joys of globalization, opening up countless avenues of experience and
                        culture to people who, a century ago, wouldn’t have had access to them. Travel can also be
                        expensive,
                        however, and dreadful for the environment. Rather than fly out to Everest to stand in line
                        behind a
                        cavalcade of wealthy tourists employing sherpas to carry them up the mountain in search of a
                        killer
                        selfie, why not take a trip in Google’s Expeditions app? Expeditions offers VR tours of iconic
                        landmarks
                        like Mount Everest or Teotihuacan, as well as educational tours built around subjects like the
                        recycling industry or even the anatomy of human skin. The 360-degree images involved are
                        intensely detailed. While Expeditions can’t capture the aura of ancient ruins or towering
                        mountains, it
                        does provide excellent learning experiences that won’t gobble up your travel budget or pump
                        carbon

                    <p>Penrose Studios’ free-to-play, stop-motion VR film experience chronicling the story of a young
                        girl in a cloud-borne village is absolutely breathtaking. In Allumette, you act as the camera,
                        exploring the gorgeously drawn world however you please — even ignoring the main storyline, if
                        you so
                        desire. Make no mistake: This is a narrative, not a game. Though none of the characters in
                        Allumette
                        actually speak, per se, the forms of communication they do use (emotive, Sims-like noises,
                        mostly) do an effective job of conveying emotion and intent.The story itself — based loosely
                        upon a poem
                        by Hans Christian Andersen is both charming and heartrending, though we won’t spoil too much
                        here.
                        Few VR experiences create the same sense of weight and presence for the viewer, and in
                        Allumette,
                        you’ll truly feel like you’ve been transported into a storybook world. The 20-minute runtime is
                        an
                        eternity in comparison to most narrative-based VR experiences — few even reach the 10-minute
                        mark — but
                        Penrose CEO and founder Eugene Chung considers virtual and augmented reality to be the future of
                        storytelling, and pushing boundaries is the only way to break paradigms. Allumette lies
                        somewhere in
                        the murky realm between filmic narrative and video games, but somehow it rises above genre as a
                        simply divine experience.If you enjoyed Allumette and you have access to an Oculus Rift, Henry
                        is also worth checking out.</p>

                    <p>Top-notch sound design and wonderful, Samurai Jack-esque animation are the driving forces behind
                        Colosse, a short-story VR experience that responds to the rooted player’s gaze, moving the
                        narrative forward seamlessly. Described by developer Fire Panda as a “real-time virtual reality
                        storytelling experience,” Colosse revels in its sense of scale, with clever details throughout.
                        For instance,
                        the “hunter” character is rendered at just 12 frames per second, while the rest of the film is
                        in
                        60, contributing to its unique atmosphere.
                        Audio and visual cues direct the player’s gaze, and certain objects “wait” to activate until you
                        look at them, which provides a natural sense of pace. Certain events will occur depending upon
                        the direction you’re facing, so you’ll never be stuck searching for the next piece of the
                        puzzle.
                        Originally designed as a demo for the Oculus Mobile VRJam, Colosse isn’t quite as fleshed out as

                    <p>When you look up at the night sky and gaze into the vastness of the universe, marveling at the
                        infinite nothing and everything of creation, time, and space, you’re probably wondering…did
                        someone make a VR app for this? You’re in luck because they did!
                        Titans of Space is an immersive journey through the planets and moons of our solar system. It is
                        a highly educational app but don’t let that deter or bore you. Flying through the cosmos on your
                        VR headset is as exciting as it is informative. You’ll be taken through guided educational
                        activities, but are also free to drift through the stars performing your own EVA (Extravehicular
                        Activity).
                        Bet you didn’t think learning about Saturns 82 moons could be fun? Well, it is.
                        Take a journey with your “Flying Professor” tour guide as you experiment with the gravitational
                        pull of different planets. You’ll analyze each planet with radar, topographic maps, and more.
                        Explore
                        the wonders of our solar system from the comfort of your living room.</p>

                    <p>When VR began to blossom as an entertainment medium, one of our first thoughts was: “Google Earth
                        is going to be super freaking cool.” Turns out, we were right. Flying around the planet like
                        some
                        kind of hypersonic eagle is both enjoyable and educational, at least if you happen to like
                        geography.
                        And even if you don’t, you can still use the quick-nav menu to visit landmark sites like the
                        Sphinx
                        or the Golden Gate Bridge or pay a digital visit to the capital of Djibouti.
                        Unsurprisingly, lots of landscapes and areas appear to be little more than colorful smudges
                        (especially if you’re using Google Cardboard), but it’s a free app, so what are you gonna do?
                        Zooming across vast distances in a matter of seconds and descending upon mammoth structures like
                        the Hoover Dam is exhilarating, even if you can’t make out the individual cars driving across
                        it.
                        Chances are, you’ve used Google Earth before, so you know the drill. It only gets more fun in
                        virtual reality; just don’t expect too much detail.</p>

                    <p>Using your VR headset to watch content from Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube is fun. It’s like having
                        your own personal IMAX movie theater to visit any time you want, without dropping obscene
                        amounts of
                        coin on popcorn and cookie dough bites. Littlstar VR Cinema changes the game by offering a full
                        library of 360-degree videos designed to make you feel like you’re the cameraman. Whether you’d
                        prefer
                        to educate yourself about the state of Nepal post-earthquake or simply jam out to some music
                        videos, Littlstar provides a point of view that you just can’t get anywhere else.
                        There’s Broadway theater content, sports content, and content for kids, making this one of the
                        best VR experiences out there. It’s also absolutely free. The user interface is smoother on some
                        platforms than it is on others — looking at you, Rift — but that’s a minor complaint. If you’re
                        the creative type, you can even film and upload your own 360-degree content for others to view
                        and
                        enjoy.</p>

                    <p>Have you ever fantasized about navigating your computer in virtual reality, like that episode of
                        The Fairly Odd Parents where Timmy actually goes inside the internet? Neither have we. If that
                        sound interesting, though, boy, do we have some good news for you! Virtual Desktop lets you use
                        your
                        computer in VR, whether you’re browsing the web, watching Netflix, or playing games. Hell, you
                        can even manage spreadsheets in VR, though we think that might be more of a hindrance than
                        anything. The app works well with multiple-monitor setups, and using your headset to swivel back
                        and forth
                        between screens is pretty cool.</p>

                        Fulldive platform, and the social aspect includes the ability to share content with your
                        friends. The
                        game also happens to be compatible with Google Cardboard, so accessing it is incredibly easy.
